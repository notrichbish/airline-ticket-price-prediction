# Airline Ticket Price Prediction using Correlation and Regression analysis

This project was one of the requirements within my postgraduate module called Applied Statistics. The main aim of this project is to generate an accurate model in predicting airline ticket price based on the features. The machine learning models used in this project are Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear regression. Additionally, a timeseries using AUTO ARIMA is performed to forecast the price of a particular airline in the year of 2023. The main process flow of this project is performing Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Pre-processing, Correaltion Analysis, Model Training, Timeseries Analysis, and Hypothesis Testing using ADF. 

The project is coded in R Language using the R Studio IDE.

There are 2 dataset used in this project which are located in the "Dataset" folder.

The fuil code can be viewed in the "Code.R" file. 

The fuil report can be viewed in the "Report.docx" file. 

If anyone wants to use a part of the code. Please refeence it. Thanks.
